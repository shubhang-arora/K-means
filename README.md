**NAME:** <br>
K-Means Clusstering

**DESCRIPTION** <br>
k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

**How To Run** <br>
Download the [jar File](https://github.com/shubhang-arora/K-means/blob/master/demo.jar), and run the demo by double-clicking the jar file or by running it in a terminal with

```bash
$ java -jar ekmeans.jar
```

The demo supports importing data from a CSV file. Each line terminated by a new line, must have at least two values (dimensions) separated by a comma. The first two values will be used, they must be parsable Java double.

Example:

```csv
1.52792,42.50525,MCDONALD'S (MCDRIVE),AD500 ANDORRA LA VELLA
3.9522,50.45396,MCDONALD'S,7000 MONS
4.00676,50.83615,MCDONALD'S (MCDRIVE),9400 NINOVE
```
